# Android App Library: Camera, Gallery and ImageView

## About
Welcome to our Android application. The app is part of the Open Sorce [Android App Library](https://github.com/LukPle/android-app-library.git) 
and adopts all licensing and community guidelines from this project. Please use the link in order to check out the corresponding repository.

The imageview-camera-gallery app shows a **ImageView** that can be filed by an image from the **Camera** or the **Gallery**.
This process demands the **Permissions** of the **Camera Access** and reading **External Storage**. The application serves as an example of these features.

## Features
The program shows a placeholder image inside an ImageView. The user can fill this ImageView with a picture from the camera or the gallery. Doing so means that the user
clicks on one of the two Buttons and takes the picture or chooses it. Depending on the Button the app requests the necessary permission, if not done yet.

## Usage
You can clone the repository into Android Studio by clicking "Get from VCS" in the Welcome Screen or navigating to "File - New - Project from Version Control" inside
